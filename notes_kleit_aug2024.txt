SAMSUNG TRAINING ON PYTHON FOR KLEIT 2ND YEAR STUDENTS

DAY1 MONDAY 19-08-2024

NOTE: Always download ONLY installer file (.msi file) and then install it. (THIS ONE IS BETTER)
OR
Download ONLY .zip file and extract it.

	CodeChef Account
Those interested can also create:
	* LinkedIn Account
	* StackOverFlow (Start answering the questions once you are confident)
	LeetCode

Steps
1. Create a folder named "software" inside C drive
2. Download Python from python.org
	Installer file (.msi) is downloaded
	Create a folder inside C:\software
	Cut and paste it into C:\software\python folder
	Now double click the installer and install
	(To know if python is installed, search for idle Interpreter App in windows search. In the command prompt, run: 
	$ python --version
	$ pip --version
	O/P:
	pip 24.1.1 from C:\Users\ASUS\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.11)
	
	Thus, when we install Python, we get the Pre-defined Modules, the Python interpreter which included the compiler and runtime machine (PVM), idle App to run python scripts, python and pip CLI (command line interface)

Steps to create PAT (Personal Access Token)
	Click on your profile Photo (Right Top corner) -> next page
	Click Sttings (Down in the list) -> next page
	Sroll down and Click Developer Settings -> next page
	Click PAT -> Click PAT classic -> next page
	Click PAT -> Select Classic PAT
	In the list, slect -> Repo, Write Packages and delete packages and Click Create button
	Copy the PAT and save it in some Safe place
	
Steps to Sync our Git Repo to our local machine:
	Copy the URL of your git Repo
	Add '@' symbol before 'github' in the URL
	Add the PAT before the '@' in the modified URL
	Now run the Command: git clone <URL with PAT>
	You should get the Repo folder in your system/laptop
	Copy the necessary files and folders into your Repo folder
	
Steps to Sync Local Repo with Cloud Repo:
	1. Click on +  (stage the changes)
	2. Add the relevant message in message box and click Commit
	3. Click Sync and Click Ok

MAKE SURE YOU CONFIGURE YOUR USER.NAME AND USER.EMAIL IN GIT:
	$ git config --global user.name "neelmyna"
	$ git config --global user.email "nithincheeta@email.com"

In the case of AND, put that condition 1st which has highest probability to fail.
c1 and c2 and c3 ...... and c10

In the case of OR, put that condition 1st which has highest probability to succeed.
c1 or c2 or c3 or c4
